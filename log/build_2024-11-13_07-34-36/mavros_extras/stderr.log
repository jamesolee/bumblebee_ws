[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:30 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmavros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "mavros", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mavros" with any
  of the following names:

    mavrosConfig.cmake
    mavros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mavros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "mavros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "mavros"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
