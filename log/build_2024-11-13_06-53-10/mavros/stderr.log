[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibmavconn.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libmavconn", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libmavconn" with
  any of the following names:

    libmavconnConfig.cmake
    libmavconn-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libmavconn" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libmavconn_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libmavconn" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
